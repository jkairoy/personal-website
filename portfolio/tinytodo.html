              <h3> The Design </h3>
              <sub>
                The main idea behind TinyTodo was that you should be able to
                write down nearly anything you have to do, and TinyTodo would
                know how to sort your items for maximum mental clarity. I saw
                this being best achieved through the recognition of dates and
                times, and by allowing users to input priority (i.e. #2). I
                decided that these functions should be made clear to the users
                intuitively, and thus I decided to implement text highlighting
                on application recognition of certain strings. Finally, I
                decided to have a “done” list that todo items would be moved
                to after completion. I saw this as having two functions,
                giving the user the option to undo an accidental click, and
                allowing users to see how many items they have completed,
                making the application a bit more satisfying to use.

            <sub style="margin-bottom: 20px">
              The execution of the app was fairly simple, the most challenging
              part being accounting for all of the parsable strings. Standard
              Javascript regex was used to recognize appropriate strings and
              combinations of strings and thus assign priority numbers to them.
              In general, this algorithm prioritized date first and user
              assigned importance over time differences less than a day ahead.

              This project was definitely a worthwhile exploration into the
              capabilities of Electron and it surely opened the door to many
              projects to come. It was also a valuable experiment in
              responding to user feedback as I was able to iterate the
              application as my friends gave me their insights.
