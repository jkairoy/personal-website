              <sub>
                The application as we saw it, would have two major functions, to
                host your own events and manage them through the app, and to
                connect with others through mutual attendance. We saw the best
                way to implement the attendance aspect of this as being a system
                that would let you browse events freely, sorted based on a number
                of elements such as proximity, friend attendance, and date.

                For organizing events, we decided that a ticketing system might
                be helpful to allow event organizers to manage larger RSVP
                lists. Thus, we thought that a QR based ticketing system would
                work well to simplify this process. We decided that we should
                assign an individual QR identifier to each account, so users
                would have one ticket for every event they attended.
                Additionally, we decided to allow our users to invite people
                to their events by text message and through the application. We
                decided to tie this feature closely to the users contacts. The
                user would be able to look through their contacts and add their
                friends, when they sent out the invites, their friends with
                accounts would be invited through the app, and friends without
                accounts would be invited through our text message services.

              The frontend was made using React Native and Redux.js. All icons
              and images were created by myself using Adobe Illustrator. We
              decided to give the application a mascot in the form of a spaceman
              to liven up the design a little bit.

            <h6>BACKEND</h6>
            <sub style="margin-bottom: 20px">
              For the backend, we decided to initially set up our project with
              a very light and simple database, Firebase. We also made use of
              Google Firestore to send real-time notifications of invites and
              event updates. For search indexing, we made use of the Algolia
              API and for text messaging we used Twillio.
