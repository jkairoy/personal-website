              <h3> The Details </h3>
              <sub>
                For the website, I chose to go with a very minimalist design,
                opting for flat images (which I designed in Adobe Illustrator),
                and chosing a sarif/sans serif font combo. I will now discuss
                the technical details of the visual implementation, if you
                would like to know more, check out the

              <h6> THE GALAXY </h6>
              <sub>
                To make the galaxy effect, I created a few SVG circles and
                rotated them off axis (using jQuery) on separate timer loops.
                I then created a mask with these circles using a static SVG
                gradient with the typical blues and purples of space. I also
                made a few different images of assorted stars in Adobe Illustrator
                and modulated their opacities using random timers. Finally, I
                applied a gaussian blur to the SVG and feColorMatrix mask to
                reassemble the image. After this, I put on a preassembled
                planet SVG, added some mouse jiggle effects, and watched the
                very computationally taxing magic take place. This effect
                actually proved to be so taxing that I implemented a frame meter
                that checks to see if the computer can handle the animation and
                shuts it off in the first 5 sections if it can not.

              <sub>
                For the rocket ship, there were three major parts to the
                implementation one being very noticable, and two being hardly
                noticeable at all. I will begin with a less noticed one, the
                first being the perspective trick used for the rocket window.
                The rocket is actually split into two different components,
                the window and the body. The body and the window move around
                the mouse at different rates to simulate perspective from the
                point of view of the mouse. This was implemented using Tween
                for movement. Not a very noticeable feature, but still fun.
                Next, I created the exhaust using a loop of relocating and
                moving opaque spheres from the location of the rocket ship.
                Finally, as a small easter-egg-ish feature, I implemented a
                mouse tracking feature that will make the exhaust become more
                uncontrollable and more opaque when the mouse is hovered over
                it. It’s likely that no-one will ever notice this, but I
                enjoyed it nonetheless.

              <h6> THE BEAR </h6>
              <sub>
                I felt that the bear was emblematic of the club, being a brown
                affiliated organization. I also felt the need to give it
                headphones, which naturally lead to the need to animate a slew
                of musical notes. This was the simplest animation to complete,
                essentially being a replication of the rocket exhaust but at a
                much slower period and with much lower animation speed.
                Everytime a musical note is created, its opacity is animated
                in a promptly animated out, leading to the smooth appearance
                and disappearance.
