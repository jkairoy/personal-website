<p>Full Stack is now entering its second year in existance. With around 140 members, we have completed several projects and
are in the process of completing several more. We are also in the process of planning a hackathon that should take place
later this year! Check out our <a href="https://fullstackatbrown.com/index.html">website</a> to see what we are up to!</p>

<p>Administrators also have access to the admin portal, where we are able to manage and process different project
proposals, tracking their statuses and adding notes where needed. The admin portal also gives users the ability to start
and manage project selection rounds, project groups, and users. Much of the information managed through the admin portal
is piped directly to the public side of the site, on the <a href="https://www.fullstackatbrown.com/about">about</a> and <a href="">projects</a> pages.</p>
