      <description>The Problem Logic Pro X is a music production DAW with various features, among these features is the ability to import and use your own audio files as samples. The problem with this however, is that Logic Pro only supports a restrictive subset of audio file types. Most of my files were .wav files, however, Logic Pro does not support bit depths &amp;lt;= 8 and &amp;gt;= 32. Thus, my files of 8 and 32 bit depths could not be used with Logic.</description>

      <description>The Goal To help Brown organizations by giving them access to high-quality web applications developed by Brown students while giving brown students the opportunity to improve their practical skills by developing useful applications
  The Design  We felt that the best way for messages like this to be communicated was through a message-board-esque design, where posts could be made, found, and commented on. We wanted to avoid triggering our users at all costs, thus, we gave the option to include possibly triggering topics, which would essentially sensor the post until a confirmation had been given.</description>

      <description>The Problem Brown University previously had a student-maintained API to give quick access to real-time laundry and dining data. However, the developers graduated and the repository sunk into deprecation as the websites they sourced their data from changed.
  The Goal To reboot the Brown API, fixing it and making it more efficient, modular, and readable
  The Execution I began with a fork of the original Brown API repository and found that there were several problems.</description>

      <description>The Goal To improve calibration efficiency by increasing the speed of troubleshooting and collecting data to better estimate the completion of the burnin process.
  How This was completed through a combination of experimental mobile app troubleshooting guides, handsfree augmented reality information interfaces, and an IIoT data collection and transfer network. I am unable to give more details here, but please reach out to me if you are curious.</description>

      <description>The Goal To quickly learn about developing for desktop with Electron while making a useful todo app
  The Design  The main idea behind TinyTodo was that you should be able to write down nearly anything you have to do, and TinyTodo would know how to sort your items for maximum mental clarity. I saw this being best achieved through the recognition of dates and times, and by allowing users to input priority (i.</description>

      <description>The Goal To create a platform for people to organize get togethers and fun events as well as connect to others based on mutual event attendance
  The Design  The application as we saw it, would have two major functions, to host your own events and manage them through the app, and to connect with others through mutual attendance. We saw the best way to implement the attendance aspect of this as being a system that would let you browse events freely, sorted based on a number of elements such as proximity, friend attendance, and date.</description>
