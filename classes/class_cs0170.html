            High-level computer architecture and systems programming. The
            course covers the organization of computer systems (in terms of
            storage units, caches, processors, and I/O controllers) and teaches
            students assembly-language programming and C language programming.
            Extensive programming exercises introduce students to systems-level
            programming on Linux systems, as well as to multithreaded
            programming with POSIX threads. Students will learn the basics
            of how compilers work and will be introduced to the functions of
            operating systems."

            This C programming assignment contained two parts: first we
            wrote a program generator, which generated mazes; then we wrote
            a program solver, which solved those mazes.
